		We are a small group of passionate high school student programmers
		from Montgomery County, Maryland. We each have years of programming
		under our belts, with some of publishing apps and websites, and
		winning awards at competitions like BlairHacks, MCPSCTF, PicoCTF
		and more. We have great understandings of the languages we teach
		and hope to pass that understanding onto our students through
		patience and good practice. Learn about our well-organized class
		structure below.

			</div>
			<p>Via Zoom, we host one hour classes on the weekend, typically with three teachers per class. We utilize Zoom's "breakout room" feature, so students or small groups of students with a niche problem can receive help separate from the main class, then return to class.</p>

				<h3 class="w80" style="padding-left: 4px">Google Classroom</h3>
			</div>
			<p>We use Google Classroom to communicate with our students. Google Classroom makes it easy to keep track of assignments, organize our teacher-made resources and notify students of anything (like Zoom links or discussion boards for out-of-class help).</p>

			</div>
			<p>Our teachers create curricula focused on learning and understand important features of each language without advanced technical details, to move at a comfortable pace, formatted as Google Slides presentations and assignments.</p>
